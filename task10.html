    <h3>shark</h3>
    <p>Sharks use their gills to filter oxygen from the water. They are a special type of fish known as "elasmobranchs", which translates into fish made of cartilaginous tissues—the clear gristly stuff that your ears and nose tip are made of.</p>
    <h3>catfish</h3>
    <p>Extant catfish species live inland or in coastal waters of every continent except Antarctica. Catfish have inhabited all continents at one time or another. They are most diverse in tropical South America, Asia, and Africa, with one family native to North America and one family in Europe. More than half of all catfish species live in the Americas. They are the only ostariophysans that have entered freshwater habitats in Madagascar, Australia, and New Guinea.</p>
    <h3>Jellyfish</h3>
    <p>hough the venom of most jellyfish is not harmful, some can be deadly. For example, the Indo-Pacific box jellyfish—or sea wasp—releases venom that makes the heart contract. There is an antidote, but the poison acts fast, so someone who is stung must seek medical attention immediately.</p>
